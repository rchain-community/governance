# governance

We aim to be a leaderless collective.

The basic decision process can be sociocratic consent.


Governance by consent is our aim.

We can enploy self management principles, delegating decisions to one person or a team. Agreements are peer to peer, not generally with the collective. Nobody can tell anybody what to do.

Small teams work best and personal relationships among members make successful organizations.

Teams may adopt their own decision processes.

Everyone here can participate in governance and call for action approved by trusted community members or community vote.
